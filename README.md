# DumpinStars LudumDare42
Well, this is our game and our first nonlocal Gamejam. Dumpin' Stars is a game about dragging trash into the pressing machine to keep your dump clean to not to run out of space. To not to colapse your dump, you will send your trash to your competitor. 

Inputs are WASD to the player on the left and the arrows to the player on the right. They must draw all the trash they can to the pressing machine in order to avoid the trash bar from filling up, because that means that you lose.

You will have some spicy combos according to what kind of trash you smash.
